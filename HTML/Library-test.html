                <small>Read ??? -17/01/2025</small>
                <p>I find it fascinating how every member of your family or even your entourage knows a different part of yourself that makes a whole.
                    This book was so soothing and new for me. It was my cousin (hey love!) that gifted it to me, as well as several other books that 
                    I cannot wait to read !! I tend to stay in my comfort zone when reading but it was a very pleasant surprise to like this one. If 
                    you're in need to be brought back to a warm and refreshing environment go for it. It helped me go past my reading slump, I took my time reading it. 
                    It made me think about my own family and friends (that are all so sweet) but also about the more ignored themes like: racism (to see all minorities are facing the same hardships *sigh*), 
                    agressions on women, toxic relationships and manipulation. The power Mathias had over Sisun because he was white and famous 
                    (like, people were condemning Sisun for getting away and "causing his death", when he was just a dramatic freak).

                <h2>Chess Story & Letter from an unknown woman - Stefan Zweig</h2>
                <small>Read 30/08/2024 - 02/09/2024</small>
                <p>
                    This book fascinated me with its poetic mess. The quality of the writing really appealed to me. I read it mainly because I was obsessed with chess, and I was surprised to discover 
                    the unraveling of the true main character from a spectator's eyes. It was a wonder he managed to regain control in the end—it was strangely hopeful to see someone fight themselves 
                    to stay on the right path. The book depicts both the cruelty and the wonder of what solitude can make you achieve, with some very interesting characters.</p>
                <p>Heartwrenching how she revolved around a man who didn’t acknowledge her efforts. This woman was desperate for love, even though she had a good life. How futile his existence seemed,
                     while she was so deeply in love with him. It’s like when you have a crush on someone who doesn’t even notice you—investing so much while they stay oblivious. I really liked it, so
                      I might continue reading Zweig's works—he has a way of diving deep into human emotions that hits hard.</p>

                <small>Read</small>
                <p>The end felt bittersweet: their relationship was beautiful but still doomed to failure It is the kind of book where you learn random facts if you pay attention. It is a story about
                     relationships; dull-hurting, sad and beautiful à la fois because love doesn't make it all. It is the first time I happen to genuinely like this type of book and not feel too bored.
                      I guess it's also because everytime I read a book it has to be on the right time. As if it clicked with whatever I live at the time. How we're all built by our relations.

                <p> How can someone DRASTICALLY change like so? That is scary! I really hope no human can do so, but
                    I know that’s being delusional. If only lord Henry, aka Prince Paradox, had shut is mouth and just went! And
                    Oh Basil, our precious beloved Basil… A wonder I got to go through the various random enumeration of historical
                    facts and objects that Dorian came to learn about! That was so long and tedious to read as a French native. The book was clearly an interesting experience but I hope not
                    as such the as one Dorian read during his lit’le journay. Like imagine if I randomly decided that this book changed me and start doing the craziest things known to earth because of it??
                     (The guy was fully convinced he wasn’t, at any moment, at fault). The ending was exquisite dramatic and beautiful. Just as I like ‘em.</p>

            <p>How delightful to plunge into this universe again. To learn more about Cardan was really comforting. He doesn’t 
                seem to be such a meanie now? He absolutely loves Jude and that’s, oh so great. I loved the different stories 
                they were well written and told. I love it, I love it, I love it. And far most, the moment where
                Cardan is on earth spending moments with Jude, Viv, Heather and Oak. Plus it was so funny to think of Madoc living there (before I learned how he lived on earth in the prisoners throne)!

                    for a 6th page. A depressed but still hopeful version of 16 wishes. WHY wouldn’t they give her some memories

                    HAVE ANXIETY!! I really like Hugo’s theory about life quantum page 144 or so. The last third especially felt like 
                    a letter to a younger self, to encourage her to continue on her “when I grow up I will be” journey and I really loved that.

                <p>Arghhhhh I feel sooo nostalgic. It was sooo great eventhough I struggled to get through it. Everybody almost died or literally did or what?
                    The Zumra was oh so loveable. And Nasir and Zafira? Oh my I couldn’t breathe they were sooo cute. I add Haider in the list of great villains
                     (yes. I was seduced). And the WORLD BUILDING? The author did such a great job. Well I just loved it I must say. To be honest I clearly cannot 
                     remember all the things. Over 1400 pages guys that’s too much for my brain. But I saw a good part of all the hints and it was done sooo very well I’m glad I read this series 😌

                <p> IM INTO IT! At first I was sooo bored and hated Zafira’s chapters but when they arrived at Sharr?
                    OH. MY. All I needed was Deen to die. Seriously what's the point of being you Deen? (No hate :))And now that the
                    tension is here… I’m like don’t stooop. 🤭.
                    Anyway I just love Altair! If he dies I stop everything (yes Yasmine I’m talking about yah).
                    Also the family tree is soooo messed up seriously. At some point I started to reread some pages cause
                    I was like wait what?. But it was SO GREAT.
                    I screamed but I screamed LOTS there was too much of EVERYTHING.I absolutely loved it and was pretty much surprised to be sad at Benyamin’s death.
                    Now trêve de bavardage and give me the next volume I cannot be left with all this tension. Speaking

                     half of the book? Well. It was an okay book, but I would've liked if the plot was a bit deeper. I've  had the impression to be here
                     only for the plot, that is the love story and the hunt since all the other potentially interesting things about the
                      book were shut down pretty fast. I'm kind of disappointed 'cause I really bought the book for it's cover.</p>

                <p> The amount of secrets in this book is crazy. I loved it. The fact that the main character is "discovered" to be the villain was sooo satisfying. It's so original (yes, I'm obsessed with villains they just tend to be more interesting to me).
                     It really was great to read this book, love the knight, london, power, dark, secret, bourgeois and astonishing vibe (in my notes I added -y or ish to every word here), with the writing that made me dive indo the freaking story.
                     Can't wait for the next volume, to laugh demonically while reading the plot in a few sitting, again!

                <p>I remember reading this book back in 2018 because I was dying to watch the movie (Cole Sprouse was in it, and I loved Riverdale back then, so I had to see it). I couldn’t find
                     it anywhere, which led me to get the written version instead. Reading wasn’t unfamiliar to me, but this was the first novel that truly belonged to me, and I dove into it headfirst. 
                     I took it absolutely everywhere and was deeply affected by the ending. One day, I finally got to watch the movie, and of course, it disappointed me—it wasn’t even close to what my 
                     imagination had crafted. Now, rereading it, I realize how much every book I read shapes me. It’s crazy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, let’s focus on the book. My opinion, four years later: it was really cute. Not super deep, but perfect for a pre-teen looking for a funny, heartwarming story that also offers
                     a small window into a topic like illness. The movie or the book? Well, that’s for you to decide—I have no idea. And honestly, what kind of question is that?</p>

                      However, when thinking about justice, I realize that hypocrisy is so deeply rooted in society that not acting according

                <p>A book that portrays the reality of marriage and polygamy. Women reduced to their gender. We follow three of them, two stories
                     and voices intricately intertwined—Ramla, Hindou, and Safira. Forced marriage, domestic violence, and polygamy. To all of them,
                      they said "munyal", to all of them, they said patience in the face of a sealed fate they would have to fight alone. 
                    The entire book is dictated by honor, modesty, lies, hypocrisy, the reduction of women, ignorance, cruelty, rumors, and status.
                     And that is something that outraged me.</p>
                <p>

                     or that Safira remains stuck in a cycle fueled by rumors and her husband’s desires. And to top it all off, the open ending is 
                     beyond frustrating — what happens to each of them? Is there even a sliver of hope for Ramla’s survival?</p>

                <p>I could relate, and still relate, a lot to Conrad's character (especially his ideas about school in chapter 4 or friendship). He may be annoying and
                     very naïve in his wish for a totally open and secret-free friendship, but I understand him. To me, the goal in life is to be surrounded by the right
                      people. It's clear that Conrad and Hans were true friends who protected each other, especially Conrad, who avoids the problems of his mother’s racism
                       toward Hans, lies in his letter, and eventually participates in a plot against Hitler. Through his poetic writing, the author shows the complexity of
                        the situation, the senseless hatred of the time, and highlights the incoherent and hateful nature of the Nazis (Conrad's mother's absurd fear, insults
                         against religions...). Anyway, it's a well-written short story that left me in shock at the injustice that affected this beautiful friendship that could
                          never be. To me, the saddest part is that Conrad lied to protect Hans, and they were never able to meet again to explain things to each other.</p>

                <p>Um, wow! This book clearly shows the reason for my attraction to reading. It was powerful. Whether it was the twists and turns, the
                     moments of self-questioning, or the ending. It clearly depicts intergenerational trauma through significant crises. I don’t usually
                      read this kind of book, but after this one, I’m intrigued by the genre. The book addresses themes such as the cruelty of war, rape,
                       love, birth, family, silence, and secrets. The last letters were what struck me the most, and once the connections are made, a loop
                        forms, shifting from a beautiful love story to an unfortunate and heartbreaking tragedy. With a modern adaptation of the Oedipus myth,
                         Mouawad highlights several violent and difficult issues in a story about a family in crisis, trying to uncover its secrets.

                <p>A very beautiful love story, realistic both in its characters, who stay true to themselves, and in its twists and turns. They are well incorporated into
                     the unfolding and context of the story (the cruelty of the Hollywood world, marriage, homosexuality, racism, and love). I also really liked the author's
                      way of introducing topics without saying too much, as she omits certain details that later become decisive clues. (Although I guessed almost everything, 
                      which somewhat spoiled my reading.) However, I found my reading to be long and was disappointed by the plot twists hyped by the BookTok community.
                    Aside from that, I can still say that the emotional developments were pleasant and well-written, just like the beginnings of the intrigues. It wasn’t a favorite,
                     but I remember enjoying the continuity of the characters’ determination. Also, the interview/article format was refreshing and sped up my reading.</p>

                <p>Wow! I really didn’t expect to like this book (reading slump after many disappointments), but in the end, it was very inspiring, comforting, and sweet. Not to mention
                     the topics I relate to a lot, which will surely help me in life. We are shown two different ways of thinking and fighting injustices (passive or active). Honestly,
                      the beginning was slow and a bit flat, but the more I read, the more it pulled me in. I finished this enjoyable read with a lot of self-reflection. The English was 
                      easy to follow thanks to the diary format.</p>

                    Green's books have always been a safe place for me as they were the first books I owned so I'm quite biased when I give my opinion on them. Each of them hold a part of me and this one 
                    helped me be a bit more mindful about how I treated my friends when I felt anxious. (try not to drown them in your problems that is).

                <small>Read 28-30/10/2022</small>
                <p>Did I like this book? Honestly, I don’t know. It was so unexpectedly realistic that I’m just confused. The book traces
                     an ordinary life with special characters (what does "normal" really mean?). Throughout, we face a frustrating complexity,
                      blending nonexistent communication and societal questioning.</p>
                <p>
                    The lack of dialogue markers and the confusion of pronouns reflect the absence of communication; capitalism, society's place,
                     and people's views on the problems of society. All of this is woven into the not always healthy "in and out" ambiguity of Connell
                      and Marianne’s relationship. With an open ending that makes me question the purpose of the story (maybe a form of awareness?).
                    It was still enjoyable and refreshing to read, and I’ll have to reread it when I have more maturity and knowledge to move beyond 
                    the confusion and truly understand the stakes of this story, which has potential that I can’t fully grasp yet.</p>

                <p>An immense crush (heart emoji). The universe is so beautiful, it feels good to have diversity. The blend of different cultures is really well done. We find many elements from the 
                    era of the pharaohs (the Kennouan empire, necropolis, beliefs...) as well as from slavery (Malik and his sisters' perilous journey as refugees, the treatment of eshrans, raids...).
                    The characters are wonderful, I truly love them all. In the end, there are no clear-cut villains or heroes, but a lot of betrayals. I was able to guess a lot of things, but the plot
                     twists were still great. I really enjoy the action scenes, they were so hype and badass. The developments of each character, which allowed me to find small clues and explanations. 
                     The fact that Idir is now a sort of alter ego for Malik! I hope they end up becoming allies in book 2, and especially that Malik becomes much more powerful. I’m also excited to see
                      how Karina will control her powers. Nyeni/the hyena was literally everywhere, I didn’t realize it, she was almost the main character. I want to learn more about their powers and see Idir 
                      again because I find him hilarious.</p>

                <h2>Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2>
                <small>Read 04/08/2022</small>
                <p>I had a bit of trouble understanding some pages. Gatsby hoped to integrate into the aristocratic world, to win Daisy's love, just as he hoped his evolution and his world would appeal
                     to Daisy and that she would deny her feelings for Tom. Similarly, Myrtle hoped to stay with Tom, and just like Wilson, he hoped to avenge his wife's death—hope keeps us alive. Gatsby
                      spent his time scripting his life with Daisy. He created an identity for himself—wealth, grand projects, acquisitions. All of this to be worthy of his beloved. This, in turn, made 
                      her a trophy, as it would allow him to enter the aristocratic world. It’s about belonging to East Egg, not West Egg; it’s about reaching the green light. Gatsby eventually burns his
                       wings when Tom realizes his closeness to Daisy. Gatsby then realizes that no, you can’t change your past. He had already sensed the beginnings of disillusionment, everything becomes
                        more dull and less meaningful as he gets closer to his goal. He imagined a perfect future, and when he reaches the light, he sees his reality. This is how the disillusionment of the
                         American Dream is presented to us: through class struggle and a love story. Gatsby takes the role of a self-made man, driven by his past and a great deal of hope.</p>

                <h2>Jamais plus - Colleen Hoover</h2>
                <small>Read 27-29/07/2022</small>
                <p>I must say: No wonder why it's the only Colleen Hoover book I own.
                    Now bear with me because this book has been a journey of opinion. I started to read it a bit before all the controverse.
                    At the time, I didn't took great attention about the story and I liked the book in a "Oh a book about domestic violence that is written in homage to whoever it was for". Then...
                    I started to get annoyed by a LOT of things: The homeless guy plot? Like why, what, how? The lover who happens (yeah, as if meeting him while he was throwing a tantrum wasn't a redflag) to be a violent guy? 
                    The "to Ellen" letter: should I say I find that Ellen is problematic and having your character writing her odes is questionable? There I said it.
                    All this, shows the problem of dark romance in general: romanticising life a bit TOO MUCH. After the controverse, I just think that Colleen Hoover is simply not for me, as this pattern is in all her books. PAS MON DELIRE like we say in France.
                    The book was more about having a maximum of questionnable things that just annihilated the "being in that type of relationship makes you accept the unacceptable and you need to get out of it" idea I suppose the author wanted to express.

                <small>Read 07/2022</small>
                <p>
                    The book was good, but it's clearly not my favorite. This one marks the end of my journey with J. Green because I’ve grown and am moving towards other horizons. I really like the way his characters think: detached, 
                    free, and sarcastic; it helped shape my personality during my adolescence. I would love, like Hazel, to meet the author and ask him questions, with the same risk of disappointment. Anyway, the psyche of people in 
                    all kinds of situations fascinates me, so it’s time for me to explore other authors.</p>
                <p> About the book: The side effects of dying. These effects take the lead, you can’t control anything, and you just have to deal with it. (Re-reading this, I realize how much of a tortured teen I was 😂, because I read
                     all these books when I was about 13-14). The characters try to live life to the fullest. Broken people, unanswered questions, strong emotions, losses. All this in a world that keeps turning despite it all. I want
                      Augustus Waters as a friend. The parents are strong and good, and the characters love each other: it’s crazy how hardships bring people closer. But in the end, I don’t understand the hype around this one. There 
                      are better books by John Green.</p>

                <h2>We were liars - E. Lockhart</h2>
                <small>Read 26-27/05/2022</small>
                <p>A story I would call sadly comforting. It presents a wealthy family torn apart by money and possessions. The summer setting hides a huge mystery, throughout the book you keep asking: What happened during summer '15?
                    We have three spoiled princesses, focused only on their own interests, obsessed with appearances in front of others, and dependent on their grandfather and his fortune, despite all the opportunities given to them 
                    and their perfect upbringing. We also have the grandfather, the great patriarch in mourning. He uses his power to control everything, both love and inheritance, making hidden threats to his family. He is disappointed
                     by the way his descendants live; he doesn't consider them worthy of the magnificent Sinclair family.</p>
                <p>The question of need versus necessity is often raised, like in the sisters' arguments over the inheritance (the houses), or the gifts Cadence receives, justified by a non-necessity. Throughout the story, the liars play 
                    a role of rupture. They refuse to appease the grandfather and disobey the adults, which allows them to break free from the patriarch and become independent, unlike their mothers. The liars break all the rules by destroying
                     the "seat of patriarchy" during the fire (it’s clearly explained on page 255, number 68). The truth is revealed to Cadence two years after her accident. She didn’t hit her head while swimming, but actually burned herself 
                     trying to save the liars from her mistake. They died, along with the dogs. She feels so guilty that she invents a story.</p>
                <p>Thus, summer '17 is just an illusion. She was alone at Caddledown, grieving while cleaning the property. If you pay attention, the clues were clear: no replies to her emails, no hand-to-hand exchanges, her family getting closer,
                     more manic, or having nightmares... The maxims define each of the characters, the tales talk about the past, but I didn’t understand the secret behind the numbers and who kills the princesses in the story (the dragon or the patriarch?)</p>

                <p>I cried so many times reading this book, it’s both so sad and comforting at the same time. The story made me feel nostalgic, I don’t even know what to say, I’m still crying, I got so lost in it,
                     it was absolutely beautiful. Every character is so endearing and caring (except for Neo’s father, OBVIOUSLY). It shows how life is full of obstacles, good moments, and so much more. Beginnings,
                      endings, and in-betweens. It makes me want to cherish everything more. It was a bit long and complicated to read since it was my second book in English, but I enjoyed it more than anything else.
                       Anyway, the words used, the quotes, the symbols, the déjà vu, the titles—everything was so beautiful. The writing is just incredible. I never thought I’d cry, but I did the whole time. Even during
                        the positive moments, I cried. If this author has other books, TAKE MY MONEY. This has become one of my favorite books. I can’t wait to have it in paperback so I can annotate it. It’s written like
                         a poem, with rhymes (parallels), stanzas (chapters), the writing style, and the references. The characters are also really well-developed, it’s so realistic, and it impacted me deeply, both in the
                          way I think and emotionally; laughter, tears, love, and hope.

                <small>Read 13-14/07/2022</small>
                <p> I felt so nostalgic when I turned the last page of the book, even though there’s still a hint of a continuation, it’s still the end of Jude and Cardan’s story. People told me this book was
                     terrible, but honestly, I don’t think so at all. We get all the answers, a development of the characters' feelings, and their growth, and a cool ending. I didn’t want to put the book down,
                      and I finished it super fast. I was happy to see that Jude and Cardan didn’t become all sappy. But there were several things that outraged me and made me feel stupid, like “Is this a JOKE?!”
                       Clearly, this was a book for settling scores between the characters. Almost all the villains got killed (ptdrr). The fact that Cardan recognized Jude right from the start was incredibly sweet,
                        and it led to a fight where they teamed up against Madoc and the Court of Teeth, despite my expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m shocked that Madoc tried to kill Jude, but it brought them even closer together in the end ig. The reconciliation between Jude and Taryn happened solely because of their blood bond, like I said.
                     They’re sisters, and sisters are supposed to help each other, no matter what. I think Nicasia is still there because she’s “friends” with Cardan.

                    she’s going through so much and she’s super smart (because honestly, I’d be dead already in this world full of riddles). They sold me on Cardan, and now I like him — he was underestimated.
                     But what he did at the end? That really pissed me off, I was FLABBERGASTED. I think Jude is going to team up with Madoc and use the same methods as Cardan to get revenge. But Cardan is bold, really bold,
                      so we’ll see who wins in the end. And why did he keep Nicasia? Anyway, we’re still waiting for King Ben and Asha too. I just don’t get Cardan, like WHY?

                    A short story in the form of a letter from Taryn to Jude. Now that I understand her reasoning... well... STILL HATING HER. She’s borderline selfish when it comes to love, and Locke is so vicious.
                     He clearly justifies himself by saying, "Don’t forget that we don’t love like you do." They both play on their desirability. For example, the situation with Eidir shows how Taryn will likely 
                     integrate into fae society. She could’ve told Jude everything, but instead, she chose to secure her future with Locke, even if it meant hurting her twin. I didn’t get her explanation, and the
                      only thing that could make her worthy of forgiveness in my eyes is the bond of blood and nothing else. Locke is manipulative, “a sign of love”? and obsessed with Jude’s unpredictable actions.
                       They chose each other for a love that is inconsistent and versatile, leaving Jude, who wasn’t like them, behind.

                    In one word? Astonishing. First, because I was expecting a romance, and second, because THAT ENDING?! Incredible. It's centered around a political struggle, but it's anything but boring.
                    I loved it so much that I had a reading slump afterward—I needed the sequel (though I admit it took me a while to finish this one too). I also wasn’t expecting the violence, but it made everything so much better.
                    And Jude’s plan? It was predictable, but she said so many other things that my brain just shut down—I didn’t get anything. I completely forgot the most important human ability in this book: LYING.
                    Anyway, it was amazing. I can already tell this is going to be my favorite series. I loved the characters, and especially the fanart from the community. Can’t wait to read the next one.

                <p>+ Um, Taryn and Locke’s actions? OUTRAGED. I never trusted Locke anyway.

                <h2>Looking for Alaska - John Green</h2>
                <small>Read 21-24/02/2022</small>
                <p>
                    I found the book comforting. We are introduced to the lives of "typical" teenagers who are simply enjoying life. It was both hilarious and philosophical, with characters you can’t help but love. 
                    I thought the event that triggers the second part of the book would be the prank they were setting up little by little, but not at all. The actual event—Alaska’s death—completely shocked me. I 
                    didn’t see it coming at all. The transition was so abrupt that it puts us on the same level as the characters. It was still incredible. The way the characters honor her is beautiful, and the 
                    mystery around the how and why of her death adds an intriguing layer that, as the Colonel would say, is very Alaska-like. The insertion of the religion class is a bit hard to grasp at times, 
                    but it plays an important role in the story, especially with the final assignment that marks the end.
                </p>
                <p>THEORY: I believe Alaska did take her own life, but she probably did it impulsively, with the intention of ending everything—thinking she was fixing her mistakes and stopping herself from 
                    "ruining everything." She must have regretted it the very next moment, but it was already too late, and she died. In short, she couldn’t take it anymore and acted in a moment of weakness, amplified by alcohol.

                <h2>The Guinevere deception - Kiersten White</h2>
                <small>Read 01-06/03/2022</small>
                <p>
                    Originally, I didn't like stories about Arthurian legends, but this time, I really enjoyed it. The setup is quite long, and there's not much exciting at the beginning. The story truly picks up
                     towards the end, a bit after the middle of the book. Throughout the story, we search for the "villain" alongside the main character, and I got it wrong as many times as Guinevere did. Then, 
                     there's a pretty big shock when we discover part of the truth, which leads to multiple intrigues. That’s actually one of the things that really stood out to me. I even started believing that
                      the main character would turn to the "dark side." The characters are all endearing, with a strong presence of female figures. The text was sometimes complex, especially in Merlin's passages
                       or in parts written in past tenses. I hope to get answers in the next volumes. I'm hurt and shocked by Mordred's betrayal—I truly held him in my heart.

                <p>Used to love it when I was younger and dumber but right now if I read it again I’ll feel like I’m
                    loosing time. Hear me out ! These kind of books are great to laugh with the funny characters and jokes even
                    hilarious which is mainly WHY I loved them. Nonetheless the toxic dark romance books were just a phase for me (a Wattpad
                    teenager who swam in those) and it is not the person I am today so IT IS great for my memories and stuff and I keep it
                    because I loved it and have had great laughs when I think about Ben and others (I am deeply attached to my things) but as a BOOK it
                    is not for me. PLUS I remember when it was really in the 🔞parts I irked so much because I was NOT supposed to be
                    exposed to these kind of things at THIS AGE. But that’s one of my other growing stories so it is sad but that’s life.
                    I only hope that Wattpad will work something out to prevent youngsters to be able to access triggering stories as easily as I used to.

                <p>I met my  best friend over this book. We had to read it as an assignment and he is the careless type, + he did not really read at the time.
                    Me on the other hand, I was a fervent reader. So everytime we had litterature (we sat next to each other because of the teacher class placement),
                    he would get me, the quiet (NOT SHY) girl, out of my way to tell him what happened in each chapter in a bastardized version, so he wouldn’t fail. 
                    I found him a bit annoying but also very funny. And a few weeks later, he came to me to ask me, like a child: "Can we be friends?". To this day, I still 
                    stick with him. Apart from that we lived the same pattern over the book: never finished it 'cause it was disturbing to think of such future for humanity, 
                    but at least we saw the movie...
