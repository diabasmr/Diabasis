        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
        <p>First of, was the film mostly in French? because there was a slight accent (watched the French dubbed
            version but could literally read the actors lips speaking frenchy) and I loved it for once! Since I was
            perfectly able to understand (PLEASE Hollywood if you want a French part hire properly French speaking
            people I BEG YOU it’s so much better without the outrageous accent that no one understands).</p>

        <p>Also why are the men in the film kinda charming like 👀. No really I’m so sorry.</p>

        <p>The 3 fingers trap was so well put and ridiculous. It’s the second film in a month about nazism versus
            English and war (the first being The Ministry of ungentlemanly  warfare) I’ve watched and there is
            always
            that kind of hint! But this one is wayyyy better. Makes me think Germans really know about their people
            and
            culture but it’s kind of the same everywhere.</p>

        <p>W.Churchill was PLOTTING during the war like how many missions like this did he organized!?? And they’re
            so
            messily presented in here which is why I love those tarantino style movies, basically my favorite
            ones🤷🏾‍♀️</p>

        <p>« ça tient que dalle » was really the word for the Italian parts I DIED OF LAUGHTER margheretti ? Deccoco
            ?
            And the faces and gestures stoooop.</p>

        <p>Landa (Christoph Waltz) was AMAZING so so so clever. UN détective !seriously like the LAUGH ?? Girlie was
            lying straight to his
            face; he was simply impressed with the dumbass plan they freaking had. And don’t get me started on when
            he
            spoke Italian and they just stood there,fucked. like stoooop 💀!! Not them repeating with the
            🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
        </p>

        <p>The way I GASPED when I saw Emmanuelle was shoshana. She literally made a film for a really cool
            vengeance
            girlies I cannot and the red dress *faint* one I’d wear for sure + the gun in the purse.</p>

        <p>Oh and the scalp thingie was disGusTing but I still love this comic violence of Tarantino’s doing.</p>

        <p>Am I too detached ? yes. I might get canceled for watching such violent themes and laugh, I hope not I’m
            just a girl who likes films so « ne me jetez pas la pierre »😔.</p>

        <p>Hilarious one</p>

        <p>AND OF COURSE IT IS A TARANTINO GIRLLLL</p>

        <p>The piano music is sooo soothing. It made the encounter even more romantic until he IGNORED HER😟.”late
            for the date” was the theme song of the film, a reminder for both of them to come back to their loved
            one and it turned into a nostalgia that the notes perfectly depicts, it’s like a lullaby from your
            childhood.
            We should definitely make more colorful movies🌃. Nothing to see…in front of the most beautiful colored
            sky??
            Oh ok 🙃The kind that makes me love musical comedies it was so very sweet ugh j’aime L’Amour💗. The
            perfect
            comfort movie I think. Eventhough you might cry a little.</p>

        <p>The Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone duo is always funny and comforting (thinking about crazy stupid love)</p>

        <p>Like He gave up his dream and almost forget about it for what? Give her security? That is heart wrenching
            makes
            me wonder if Success and Love are compatible.</p>

        <p>Anyway I simply love a supportive couple, persons in general because humans tend to forget ‘bout their
            goals.
            That is why artists in all types/genres are inspiring PEOPLE are inspiring and we NEED a supportive
            surrounding 🤷🏾‍♀️</p>

        <p>To finish this:</p>

        <p>THEY PARTED OUT??? YOU’RE KIDDING MEEE !!! AND EVEN MADE THEIR OWN LIVES APART FROM EACH OTHER?? (Let me
            cry
            for a while please 🤧)</p>

        <p>At the very least they made their dreams come true which is cool, and they were both happy; if I may. But
            still!
            I have a romantic spirit, it simply broke my heart, hearing the theme song as they remembered and KISSED
            FIXING
            THE STORY UGHHH. AND HE CALLED IT Seb’s just THE WAY SHE DRAWED THE SIGN STOPPPP It was great 💗 really.
        </p>

        <p>And the camera work !!!</p>

        <p>+ it’s crazy how producers have a kind of signature because every time I watch a film I’m like oh it’s
            just
            as this
            film I watched and it happens to be from the same producer like Chazelle with this and whiplash or
            Babylon,
            Tarantino
            or even Wes Anderson… (I’ll watch more producers movie women ones for sure too so I’m able to recognize
            any)
