                <p> How can someone DRASTICALLY change like so? That shit is scary I really hope no human can do so but
                    I know </p>
                <p>that’s being delusional. If only lord Henry aka Prince Paradox had shut is mouth and just went! And
                    oh Basil, </p>
                <p>our precious beloved Basil… A wonder I got to go through the various random enumeration of historical
                    facts and objects</p>
                <p> that Dorian came to learn about! But the book was clearly an interesting experience but I hope not
                    as such the as one</p>
                <p> Dorian read during his lit’le journay. (The guy was fully convinced he wasn’t at any moment of
                    fault). </p>
                <p>And the ending was exquisite dramatic and beautiful just as I like ‘em.</p>

                <p>I add Haider in the list of great villains (yes. I was seduced). And the WORLD BUILDING? The author
                    did such </p>
                <p>a great job. Well I just loved it I must say. To be honest I clearly cannot remember all the things.
                </p>
                <p>Over 1400 pages guys that’s too much for my brain.

                <p> IM INTO IT! At first I was sooo bored and hated Zafira’s chapters but when they arrived at Sharr?
                    OH. MY. </p>
                <p>All I needed was Deen to die. Seriously who the fuck is you Deen? (No hate :))And now that the
                    tension is here… </p>
                <p>I’m like don’t stooop. 🤭.
                    Anyway I just love Altair if he dies I stop everything (yes Yasmine I’m talking about yah).</p>
                <p> Also the family tree is soooo messed up like wtf. At some point I started to reread some pages cause
                    I was like </p>
                <p>wait what?. But it was SO GREAT.
                    I screamed but I screamed LOTS there was too much of EVERYTHING.</p>
                <p>
                    I absolutely loved it and was pretty much surprised to be sad at Benyamin’s death. </p>
                <p>
                    Now trêve de bavardage and give me the next volume I cannot be left with all this tension. Speaking
                    of tension 😏. </p>
                <p>
                    Why is the lion of the night so freaking hot and charismatic, why are villains always making me fall
                    is the question. </p>

                <small>Read </small>
                <p>Used to love it when I was younger and dumber but right now if I read it again I’ll feel like I’m
                    loosing time.</p>
                <p>
                    Hear me out ! These kind of books are great to laugh with the funny characters and jokes even
                    hilarious which is mainly</p>
                <p> WHY I loved them. Nonetheless the toxic dark romance books were just a phase for me (a Wattpad
                    teenager who swam in </p>
                <p>those) and it is not the person I am today so IT IS great for my memories and stuff and I keep it
                    because I loved it and have </p>
                <p>great laughs when I think about Ben and others (I am deeply attached to my things) but as a BOOK it
                    is not for me.</p>
                <p> PLUS I remember when it was really in the 🔞parts I irked so much because I was NOT supposed to be
                    exposed to these</p>
                <p> kind of things at THIS AGE. But that’s one of my other growing stories so it is sad but that’s life.
                    I only hope that Wattpad</p>
                <p> will work something out to prevent youngsters to be able to access triggering stories as easily </p>
                <p>as I used to.</p>
